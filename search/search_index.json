Installation The following fostware would be installed in your cluster or computer before running the UROBORUS.pl. Perl (>=5.24.0), https://www.perl.org/get.html . Perl should be built using the useithreads configuration option. If not, you would recieve an error message \u2013 \"Perl not built to support threads\", when running UROBORUS.pl. Tophat (>=2.1.0), http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml . Bowtie (>=1.1.2), http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml . Bowtie2 (>=2.2.9), http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml . Samtools (>=1.9), http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ . Usage Before using UROBORUS.pl, you should use TopHat to align the reads to genome, and get the unmapped.sam and accepted_hits.bam files. UROBORUS.pl 2.1.1 (Oct. 1, 2019) usage: perl UROBORUS.pl -index /path/genome -gtf /path/genes.gtf -fasta /path/ unmapped.sam accepted_hits.bam Options: -index: genome index (use bowtie1 index); -gtf: gene annotation file (*.gtf file); -fasta: path for genome sequence in fasta file (*.fa) in separate chromosome; -p: threads (Integer, default = 6); -temp: keeping the temporary file (0 means no, 1 means yes, default = 0); -help: usage help; Note If the genome sequences were saved as ' chr1.fa ' or ' 1.fa ', then the -fasta should be set as -fasta path/ ; if the genome sequences were saved as ' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.1.fa ', then the -fasta should be set as -fasta path/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome ; Example Command: perl UROBORUS.pl -index bowtie1_hg19/hg19 -gtf genes.gtf -fasta Chromosomes_home/ unmapped.sa accepted_hits.bam Output file format: The output file contains eight columns: 1. Chromosome 2. Start of Junction 3. End of Junction 4. Strand 5. Parental Gene Name 6. Genomic Distance 7. Read Counts 8. Matched Transcript ID Output example: chr18 54426095 54448887 + WDR7 22792 18 NM_052834 chr5 64537930 64569274 - ADAMTS6 31344 17 NM_197941 Reference Song X , Zhang N, Han P, Lai RK, Wang K, Lu W.
